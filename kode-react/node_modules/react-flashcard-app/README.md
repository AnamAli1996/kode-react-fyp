# FlashcardApp

Node package for a flashcard application implemented as a react component.


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [https://aqueous-fortress-20350.herokuapp.com/](https://aqueous-fortress-20350.herokuapp.com/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-flashcard-app is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-flashcard-app.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-flashcard-app --save
```

## Usage

```
import FlashcardApp from 'react-flashcard-app';

const data = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Example Deck',
    cards:
    [
      'Lorem', 'dolor',
      'sit', 'amet',
      'consetetur', 'sadipscing',
      'sed', 'diam',
    ]
];

<FlashcardApp data={data} />
```

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
